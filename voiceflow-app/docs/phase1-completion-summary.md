- Created PWA installation utilities

### 4. Performance Monitoring

**âœ… Performance Tracking**
- Created PerformanceMonitor class for Core Web Vitals
- Implemented custom metric tracking
- Added interaction and resource loading monitoring
- Set up performance data collection

## ðŸ“Š Performance Results

### Bundle Size Analysis
- **Dashboard Page:** 40.3 kB (down from ~60+ kB estimated)

- **Offline Support:** Basic caching implemented

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Performance Improvements

### Immediate Benefits
1. **Faster Initial Load:** Code splitting reduces initial bundle size by ~30%
2. **Better User Experience:** Skeleton loading states provide immediate feedback
3. **Improved Core Web Vitals:** Font optimization and resource hints reduce CLS and LCP
4. **PWA Capabilities:** App-like experience on mobile devices

### Measurable Metrics
- **First Contentful Paint:** Expected improvement of 20-30%
- **Largest Contentful Paint:** Expected improvement of 25-35%
- **Cumulative Layout Shift:** Expected reduction to <0.1
- **Bundle Size:** 30-40% reduction in initial JavaScript

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test Performance:** Run Lighthouse audits to measure improvements
2. **Mobile Testing:** Verify PWA functionality on mobile devices
3. **User Testing:** Validate loading states and user experience

### Phase 2 Preparation
1. **Database Optimization:** Plan for backend performance improvements
2. **Caching Strategy:** Design Redis implementation
3. **API Optimization:** Plan for response caching and rate limiting
